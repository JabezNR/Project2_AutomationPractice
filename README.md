This project showcases my ability to handle various web elements, ensuring a thorough and versatile approach to web automation:

**TextBox and DropDown**: Automate input by typing data into text fields and selecting options from drop-down menus, mimicking real user interactions for accurate test scenarios.

**Tables**: Extract and verify data from web tables, ensuring information display accuracy and validating the integrity of table contents.

**Alerts and Pop-ups**: Manage browser alerts and pop-ups, including actions like accepting, dismissing, or extracting information, ensuring smooth test flows even with unexpected interruptions.

**ActionChains**: Simulate complex user interactions such as mouse movements, hovering, right-clicks, and drag-and-drop actions, providing a comprehensive test of UI elements and their responsiveness.
